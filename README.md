# python-hints
Facing the same questions all the time and hard to recall the solutions?

Documentations are too long to find useful functions?

I JUST WANT A LINE OF CODE I CAN USE! NO MORE BULLSHIT!

(In decent words: details later, solutions now)

**Then welcome to python-hints, a blog focusing on most useful methods.**

## PyTorch Utils:
(ATTNETION) always use torch.tensor instead of torch.Tensor, automatically matching types.
- [Tensor as index](https://github.com/necr-kyle/python-hints/blob/master/tensor-as-index.py)

## Python Utils:
- [Parser: package argparse](https://github.com/necr-kyle/python-hints/blob/master/example-parser.py)
- [Logging: package logging](https://github.com/necr-kyle/python-hints/blob/master/example-logging.py)
- [Go through all files under a directory?](https://github.com/necr-kyle/python-hints/blob/master/file-io.py)
- [Print exception info in try-except-finally?](https://github.com/necr-kyle/python-hints/blob/master/exceptions.py)
- [Load comma split .csv files? ](https://github.com/necr-kyle/python-hints/blob/master/read-csv.py)
